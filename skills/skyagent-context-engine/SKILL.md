# SkyAgent Context Engine

Use this skill when Codex needs the compact profile context before analysis, planning, or follow-up recommendations.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyagent_start` for full session bootstrap, fresh `@SkyAgent` invocation, or a host/session-start hook. It should return setup status, selected player/profile, profile context freshness policy, compact context, server/API status, objective summary, recent events and cursor, provider readiness, warnings, and follow-up tools while persisting an `agent.session_start` event.
- Use `skyagent_config_get` first when only player, UUID, selected profile, or API key setup metadata is needed before choosing a heavier context tool.
- Use `skyagent_context_bootstrap` only when `skyagent_start` is unavailable or a plain cached context capsule is enough. It should return compact identity, selected profile, profile snapshot, economy/networth summary, gear, pets, accessories, readiness, objective summary, provider freshness, warnings, and follow-up tools.
- Use `skyagent_context_get` for cached context when the user asks a follow-up and current profile state is not required.
- Use `skyagent_context_refresh` when the user says they changed gear, pets, accessories, profile progress, objectives, or wants the current route recalculated.
- Use `skyblock_profile_snapshot` only when a narrow profile-cache read is enough or when the context tool points to it as the next detail tool.
- Use `skyagent_objective_list` during bootstrap when durable objectives, todos, buy lists, source lists, or snipe targets may affect advice.
- Use `skyagent_server_status` when the context should include online state, Hypixel API availability, session mode, map, or server-status warnings.
- Route ongoing progress streams to `$skyagent-live-progress` and durable goal changes to `$skyagent-objectives`.

## Rules

- Do not ask for a Minecraft username before `skyagent_start` has checked configured identity/profile for a fresh SkyAgent session.
- Prefer the context capsule over repeated raw profile pulls for broad answers; raw/member payloads are debug or fallback tools, not the default.
- Preserve `fetchedAt`, cache status, stale status, provider freshness, warnings, and follow-up tool hints.
- Treat stale context as advisory unless the user explicitly accepts stale data or the answer is not freshness-sensitive.
- Refresh context before revising a plan after the user reports new gear, purchases, skill progress, profile changes, or market-sensitive decisions.
- Do not store API keys or secrets in context, memories, objectives, or summaries.
- Keep context output compact. Pull raw member payloads, item dumps, or full item arrays only when a narrow tool is needed.
- If MCP startup tools are unavailable, use `skyagent start --json` or `skyagent context --cache-only --allow-stale` before telling the user that startup is blocked.
- If the API key is missing, use cache-only context and public resources where possible, then return setup guidance without printing secrets.
