# SkyAgent Progression

Use this skill when the user asks where their profile stands, wants SkyCrypt-style section summaries, or needs profile progress broken down by game system.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_profile_section` for one section: `skills`, `dungeons`/`catacombs`, `slayer`, `bestiary`, `collections`, `minions`, `museum`, `garden`, `mining`/`hotm`, `crimson_isle`/`kuudra`, `rift`, `trophy_fishing`, `pets`, `essence`, `currencies`, or `unlocks`.
- Use `skyblock_progression` for all section summaries, cross-section comparisons, source-field provenance, and missing-data warnings.
- Route Senither/Lily-style weight, unsupported exact formulas, or activity readiness to `$skyagent-readiness-weight`.
- Use `$skyagent-context-engine` for broad progression questions; prefer `skyagent_context_get` when no startup payload is present so cached profile context, objective summaries, server status, recent events, provider freshness, and follow-up tools are loaded first.
- Use `$skyagent-live-progress` when recent skill gains, Slayer kills, dungeon runs, Garden changes, profile refreshes, or explicit progress events may affect section status.
- Use `$skyagent-objectives` when progression gaps should become todos, source-item tasks, or tracked objective progress.
- For Museum donation goals, route to `$skyagent-planning` and `skyblock_museum_donation_plan` before generic progression. Use the `museum` section for compact progress/value evidence, and fall back to `skyblock_museum`, `skyblock_profile_member`, or `hypixel_request` only for missing planner fields.

## Rules

- Preserve source fields, formula/table provenance, warnings, and assumptions.
- Name the XP curve or summary formula used for skills, Catacombs, Slayer, HotM, Garden, or section summaries when present.
- Distinguish missing API data from real zero progress.
- Treat absent sections, disabled APIs, and partial profile payloads as missing data, not as proof the user has no progress.
- Verify current external meta before making patch-sensitive claims about Dungeons, Slayer, Kuudra, Garden, Mining, or Rift priorities.
- Refresh context before comparing a new progression state against an existing plan.
- Do not turn missing Museum or section parser support into generic advice; extract the narrow official fields first and mark parser coverage as partial.
