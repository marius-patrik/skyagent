# SkyAgent Inventory/Items

Use this skill when the task depends on item stacks, inventory API state, decoded NBT, normalized item records, or item metadata.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_inventory` for all supported sections or when the user asks for broad inventory, armor, equipment, wardrobe, backpacks, accessory bag, personal vault, ender chest, or pets context.
- Use `skyblock_inventory_section` for one named section such as `armor`, `equipment`, `wardrobe`, `inventory`, `ender_chest`, `backpacks`, `accessory_bag`, `personal_vault`, or `pets`.
- Use `skyblock_item_dump` only when the user asks for raw decoded NBT, parser debugging, item dumps, accessory bag item dumps, or exact low-level fields.
- Use `skyblock_normalized_items` before item reasoning across sections, upgrade checks, modifier comparisons, or user-facing item summaries.
- Use `skyblock_item_metadata` for NotEnoughUpdates-style item details, display names, rarity, category, NPC sale data, upgrade metadata, provider authority/freshness, or fallback item identity.
- Use `$skyagent-context-engine` first for broad gear, wardrobe, pets, accessories, hidden storage, Museum, or profile-context questions; prefer `skyagent_context_get` when no startup payload is present so cached context, storage availability, profile completeness, objective summary, server status, events, and follow-up tool hints are available.
- Use `$skyagent-live-progress` when recent inventory/profile refresh events may explain changed gear, pet swaps, purchases, or missing progress.
- Use `$skyagent-objectives` when item findings should become source-item, buy-list, or snipe-target records.
- For damage, Slayer, or money-route advice, inspect hidden context as well as current gear: wardrobe/loadout fallback, backpacks, ender chest, personal vault, pets, accessories, and museum-related item signals before judging readiness or recommending purchases.
- For Museum goals, prefer `skyblock_museum_donation_plan` for donation candidate routing. Use normalized item records and storage section tools as follow-up evidence when the planner reports uncertain or missing item candidates.

## Rules

- Prefer normalized output for recommendations and summaries; request raw decoded debug data only when the user asks for parser details, missing fields, or exact NBT.
- Keep raw decoded NBT behind explicit debug requests.
- Report disabled inventory API, missing sections, or partial profile data as warnings instead of treating them as empty inventories.
- Treat startup `storage` entries as availability and bounded-summary signals; use section tools only when the user goal requires item-level storage detail.
- For corrupt NBT, preserve the affected section/container ID when available, warn clearly, and continue with unaffected sections.
- If item metadata is unavailable, continue with normalized item IDs and mark metadata-backed fields as unavailable.
- Do not infer item modifiers that are not present in normalized records.
- Preserve `metadataProviderFreshness` and `modifierUncertainty` when explaining pets, skins, dyes, gemstones, attributes, enchants, dungeon quality, or Museum eligibility/value.
- Treat `observed_unvalued`, `unsupported_formula`, and `unsupported_modifier_value` fields as explicit uncertainty, not as priced or exact values.
- Refresh context after meaningful item changes before recalculating plans or readiness.
- If a section parser is missing or disabled, use the narrowest available section/raw debug fallback and mark that section as partial instead of treating it as empty.
