# SkyAgent Economy

Use this skill when the user asks about coins, prices, networth, Bazaar, auctions, LBIN, price history, provider confidence, stale caches, third-party uncertainty, or volatile markets.

## Tool Routing

- Use `skyblock_price` for one item price with provider confidence, fallback chain, cache status, stale status, and warnings.
- Use `skyblock_lowest_bin` for auctionable item LBIN and bounded Hypixel auction-scan candidates.
- Use `skyblock_price_history` for historical CoflNet-compatible context, trend checks, and volatility context.
- Use `skyblock_bazaar`, `skyblock_auctions`, `skyblock_auction`, `skyblock_auctions_ended`, and `skyblock_firesales` for live economy surfaces.
- Use `skyblock_networth` for full sectioned networth, purse/bank/item totals, unknown prices, assumptions, and provider freshness.
- Use `skyblock_item_networth` for one inventory section such as armor, equipment, wardrobe, backpacks, accessory bag, or pets.
- For agent summaries, pass bounded controls such as `maxItems`, `timeoutMs`, and `includeItems: false` when full item arrays are not required. Request item-level output only for explicit detail/debug work.
- Use `$skyagent-context-engine` when networth or price advice should be combined with cached profile context, objectives, or provider freshness.
- Use `$skyagent-objectives` when price evidence should update buy-list entries, source-item entries, snipe targets, budgets, target prices, warnings, or priority.
- Use `$skyagent-live-progress` when provider/cache events, market refreshes, or recent profile changes affect valuation freshness.
- Route patch-sensitive price-provider assumptions, parity drift, or outage checks to `$skyagent-provider-maintenance`.

## Rules

- Treat `candidatePrice` as partial unless `price` is non-null.
- Treat networth `status` or section `valuationStatus` of `partial` as incomplete coverage caused by bounds, timeout, provider failure, or unresolved prices; carry the warning codes forward instead of treating totals as exhaustive.
- Carry provider freshness, confidence, fallback chain, cache status, stale status, and warnings into recommendations.
- Call out third-party uncertainty for CoflNet-compatible LBIN/history and any community/provider-derived data.
- Treat prices as volatile; avoid strong buy/sell timing claims without recent provider data and history.
- Do not invent prices for unknown or unsupported items.
- Do not add unknown prices into networth totals; list them as missing value coverage instead.
- When provider data is stale or low confidence, describe the value as advisory rather than definitive.
- For budget-sensitive advice, compare resolved price against the stated budget and exclude unresolved or over-budget items from buyable recommendations.
- When persisting economic decisions, include provider, fetched time, stale status, confidence, fallback chain, and warnings.
